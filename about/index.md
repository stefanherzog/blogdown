I am a **cognitive-science researcher** interested in how to **improve peopleâ€™s judgment and decision making**.
To this end I combine insights from research on heuristics and bounded rationality, "wisdom of crowds" and machine learning.

My broader scientific interests are:

- judgment and decision making,
- bounded rationality and heuristics,
- social decision making and the "wisdom of crowds",
- medical decision making,
- risk communication,
- decision tools and decision aiding,
- computational modeling,
- Bayesian statistics, and
- machine learning
