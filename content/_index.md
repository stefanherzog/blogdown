  I am the <a href='https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/research/research-centers/adaptive-rationality/research-areas/boosting-decision-making' target = '_blank'>head of the research area "boosting decision making"</a> and <a href='https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/staff/stefan-herzog' target = '_blank'>senior researcher</a> at the <a href='https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/research/research-centers/adaptive-rationality' target = '_blank'>Center for Adaptive Rationality</a> at the <a href='https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en' target = '_blank'>Max Planck Institute for Human Development</a> in Berlin. <br/><br/>
  
  I study how to boost human judgment and decision making (<a href='https://scienceofboosting.org' target = '_blank'>scienceofboosting.org</a>) by investigating human and machine behavior and how humans themselves understand machines. I combine insights and methods from cognitive science, collective intelligence ("wisdom of crowds"), heuristics, and algorithms.
