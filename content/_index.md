description:
  I study how to boost human judgment and decision making (<a href='https://scienceofboosting.org' target = '_blank'>scienceofboosting.org</a>) by investigating human and machine behavior and how humans themselves understand machines. I combine insights and methods from cognitive science, collective intelligence ("wisdom of crowds"), heuristics, and algorithms.<br/><br/>
  
  I also work on <a href='sks.to/rao' target = '_blank'>applications in digital environments</a>, medical decision making, and meteorology. Furthermore, I am co-leading an initiative on reconfiguring behavioral science for crisis knowledge management in response to COVID-19 and other, future disruptive events (<a href='https://scibeh.org' target = '_blank'>scibeh.org</a>).
