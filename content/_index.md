  I head the <a href='https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/research/research-centers/adaptive-rationality/research-areas/boosting-decision-making' target = '_blank'>research area "boosting decision making"</a> and am a <a href='https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/staff/stefan-herzog' target = '_blank'>senior research scientist</a> at the <a href='https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/research/research-centers/adaptive-rationality' target = '_blank'>Center for Adaptive Rationality</a> at the <a href='https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en' target = '_blank'>Max Planck Institute for Human Development</a> in Berlin. <br/><br/>
  
  I study how to **boost human judgment and decision making** (<a href='https://scienceofboosting.org' target = '_blank'>scienceofboosting.org</a>) by investigating human and machine behavior—drawing on psychology, cognitive science, AI, collective intelligence, and computational social science. My work addresses key challenges facing individuals, organizations, and societies: building better and more trustworthy **hybrid human–AI teams**, ensuring AI supports (rather than erodes) **human competences**, and strengthening **resilience against misinformation, manipulation, and risks of generative AI**.
