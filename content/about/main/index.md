  I study how to boost human judgment and decision making (<a href='https://scienceofboosting.org' target = '_blank'>scienceofboosting.org</a>) by investigating human and machine behavior and how humans themselves understand machines. I combine insights and methods from cognitive science, collective intelligence ("wisdom of crowds"), heuristics, and algorithms.
  
  I also work on <a href='sks.to/rao' target = '_blank'>applications in digital environments</a>, medical decision making, and meteorology. Furthermore, I am co-leading an initiative on reconfiguring behavioral science for crisis knowledge management in response to COVID-19 and other, future disruptive events (<a href='https://scibeh.org' target = '_blank'>scibeh.org</a>).
  
  I am the <a href='https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/research/research-centers/adaptive-rationality/research-areas/boosting-decision-making' target = '_blank'>head of the research area "boosting decision making"</a> and <a href='https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/staff/stefan-herzog' target = '_blank'>senior researcher</a> at the <a href='https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/research/research-centers/adaptive-rationality' target = '_blank'>Center for Adaptive Rationality</a> at the <a href='https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en' target = '_blank'>Max Planck Institute for Human Development</a> in Berlin.
  
  In 2010 I received the <a href='https://sjdm.org/history.html' target = '_blank'>Hillel Einhorn New Investigator Award of the Society for Judgment and Decision Making</a>. My research has been published in leading academic journals in psychology, cognitive science, judgment and decision making, medicine, and meteorology; has been covered in the popular press (e.g., Scientific American) and appears in academic and popular science books (incl. Tetlock and Garner's "Superforecasting"").
  
  I have organized and presented at national and international workshops, symposia and conferences and have been invited to give talks and keynotes at academic institutions in the US, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, and the UK (incl., The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, University of California, London School of Economics, ETH Zürich, Ecole Normale Supérieure, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods).
  
  I studied psychology, management, and computer science, and received my psychology doctorate in 2009 from the University of Basel.
